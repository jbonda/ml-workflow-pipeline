Hi Everyone!
Welcome to our Machine Learning-GUI Web Application!

This platform allows you to do the following tasks.
1. Uploading data,
2. split the data into train and test sets
3. visualize it to gain insights using machine learning techniques.
4. Training and validation of machine learning models (Linear regression and Logistic Regression) will be implemented during the later stages.

Here are the scikit learn links to understand Linear Regression and Logistic regression.
LogisticRegression: https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression.html
LinearRegression: https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression.html
